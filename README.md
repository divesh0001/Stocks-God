## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Deployment Status

The backend is currently **not deployed** due to compatibility issues with TensorFlow and CUDA on the deployment server. 
This is causing errors related to missing GPU drivers as TensorFlow is unable to detect CUDA drivers, leading to CPU fallback.

## LSTM Model for Stock Prediction

We have implemented an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for stock price prediction. The model is trained on historical stock price data and provides forecasts for the next 30 days.

### Prediction Results

- **Current Stock Price**: 337.8 (Example of Tesla Inc.)
- **Predicted Price After 15 Days**: 323.4 
- **Predicted Price After 30 Days**: 313.21 

The LSTM model helps users get an idea of future stock price trends, enhancing decision-making.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements  

### Stock Market Sentiment Analysis using Tweets  

We are currently working on integrating a **Sentiment Analysis Model** using Twitter/X data to predict market trends based on investor sentiment.  

üìå **What‚Äôs Planned?**  

- Scrape Twitter/X data related to stock symbols (e.g., `$TSLA`, `$AAPL`).  
- Use **Hugging Face Transformers** (BERT, FinBERT) to analyze sentiment.  
- Predict whether **positive sentiment ‚Üí stock price increase** and **negative sentiment ‚Üí price drop**.  
- **Bonus:** Use LSTM to correlate sentiment with stock prices.
